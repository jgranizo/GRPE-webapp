Used XAMPP as a web server to run my web app, using MariaDB database to keep hold of the data from the user input and retrieve it as well.
User is suppose to click on 1 of the 3 pictures from the home page to proceed to select exercises. Each picture represents Squat(leg exercises), Bench(pushing exercises), and Deadlift(pulling exercises).
User then proceeds to the exercise generator to pick how many exercises they will do, from a specific category they initially picked as well as an other category option for exercises generated.
User then proceeds to the submit exercise form where they recieve their recommendation from their previous lift of each exercise chosen.
User then submits form and the data gets saved for the next time they do a specific exercise, they will be suggested a specific amount of weight to use and rep range to do based on an algorithm I made that includes their RPE(Rate of Percieved Exertion) and the amount of reps they previously used.
